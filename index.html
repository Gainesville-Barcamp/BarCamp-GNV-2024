        <h2>What is BarCamp GNV?</h2>
        <p>
          BarCamp GNV is an unconference - an
          ad-hoc gathering born from the desire for
          people to share and learn in an open environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sessions are given on a variety of topics, and
          the day is created collaboratively - built by
          you and the other attendees who have a topic, story,
          knowledge, or experience to share with the rest of the community.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section class="how-does-it-work">
      <div class="col-left">
        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
        <p>
          When you arrive, you'll see a big board with an empty grid with
          times along one side and 4 rooms across the top. If you have a
          talk planned, you can post it to that board starting at 8:00am.
        </p>
        <p>
          Grab a sticky, write your name and a short description of
          the talk, and post it to the schedule. As the board fills up,
          attendees can start to see what's happening and when - and plan
          their day. You can sign up to present until the last slot is filled.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-right">
        <h2>Can I give a talk?</h2>
        <p>
          Yes! We encourage any attendee interested in giving a talk to post
          their topic on the board, but it is not required. Remember,
          sessions aren't limited to just "talks," it can be a presentation,
          panel, or discussion group.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an ice breaker, we'll seed the schedule with 5 - 10 featured
          sessions, just to get the ball rolling. Interested in being a
          featured speaker? <a href="mailto:team@startgnv.com?subject=Barcamp%20Featured%20speaker%20request">Let us know</a>.

        <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="col-left">
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h3>Does BarCamp have something to do with bars or camping?</h3>
            <p>
              Nope, it doesn't. The "BarCamp" name arose as an open to the
              public alternative to Foo Camp, which is an invitation-only conference.
              Under 21 are welcome, and please don't bring your tents!
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>What is the cost to attend?</h3>
            <p>
              $10! We change you a bit of money to make sure you're actually planning on attending. The
              ticket price includes coffee, lunch, and lots more!
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>What will the session topics be?</h3>
            <p>
              The majority of sessions are not prearranged.
              Attendees propose their own session ideas on the day of the event,
              and the schedules are updated throughout the day to make sure
              the most popular sessions get the largest rooms.
              Although topics should lean heavily to a tech and creative audience,
              one of the most fun parts of BarCamps are the 'kitchen sink'
              talks like 'How to roast your own coffee' or 'Lockpicking'.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>How long are the talks?</h3>
            <p>
              The schedule allots 30 minutes for each session but you
              should leave some room for Q&A afterwards and travel time between sessions.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Do I have to give a talk?</h3>
            <p>
              Absolutely not! Many people come to BarCamp just to meet new people
              and listen to other folks give presentations, and that's great!
              We encourage people to participate however they are most comfortable.
              That's the beauty of the unconference. You can pretty much do whatever you want.

          <li>
            <h3>What should I bring?</h3>
            <p>
              BarCamp attendees don't need to bring anything more but themselves and
              a thirst for knowledge, but here are a few suggestions:
              <ul>
                <li>Notepad, pen/pencil for taking notes and collecting autographs</li>
                <li>Something to share with attendees (i.e. business cards)</li>
                <li>A friend</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Will internet be provided?</h3>
            <p>
              Sorry, no internet will be provided so prepare any materials you need ahead of time.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Can I give a sales presentation?</h3>
            <p>
              Nope. To be respectful of our BarCamp attendees, sales presentations, or all-out sales
              pitches are not allowed. Don't even try it, folks.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>What if people walk out during a talk?</h3>
            <p>
              If a talk or discussion in one room isn't of interest to you,
              feel free to walk out and join another session.
              If you're giving a talk, don't worry if people do this.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Will food and drinks be provided?</h3>
            <p>
              Yes, food will be provided. Coffee and a light lunch.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>

            <p>
              For millennia, cities at crossroads have been associated with innovation, 
              commerce and the exchange of culture and ideas. Gainesville is a 21st Century 
              crossroad city, and our international community is at the heart of our 
              emergence as a new global city!

              Experiential Storytelling in Six Words
            </h4>
            <p>
              This presentation will explore storytelling as an experiential learning 
              experience and will focus on how the stories we tell to other people about 
              ourselves are the most powerful ones. This will be a highly interactive and 
              engaging experiential workshop in which participants will have the 
              opportunity to engage in identifying their own stories through creative 
              story prompts and "flipping the script" in six words. 
              I will lead the group in reframing their stories through recognizing 
              radical acceptance, cognitive flexibility and how we become our 
              stories for either better or for worse.
